# Spotify-EDA-and-Recommendation-System

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis in Python and made a music Recommendation System using Spotify's dataset.
- Used various Python libraries and packages like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.
- Drawn insights and correlations among different attributes of a song using a correlation heat map and regression plots.
- Visualized how music's overall sound has changed over the years and the characteristics of numerous music genres.
- Discovered clusters in the dataset using the K-means clustering algorithm and visualized them using t-SNE and PCA.
- Installed and imported the Spotipy library to fetch and query Spotify's music catalog for songs from Spotify's Web API.
- Generated the song recommendations using sklearn's similarity metric euclidean distance and scipy's distance metric.
